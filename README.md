## 👽 Welcome to the Mothership.  
Liquid OS is an autonomous AI coordination layer designed to power the next generation of decentralized systems.  
Modular. Intelligent. Always on.

This is not your average protocol logic. This is off‑world AI.

## 🌌 What is Liquid OS?  
Liquid OS is an intelligent system that brings real‑time, AI‑powered automation to any decentralized environment. Originally incubated as an internal tool, it has now evolved into a standalone framework that enables:

- 🧬 **Autonomous Decision‑Making:** Reacts to on‑chain data, oracle updates, and time‑based triggers.
- 🪐 **Modular Prompts:** Swappable and extensible logic capsules for task‑specific decisions.
- 🤖 **Human‑AI Coordination:** Supports real‑time command execution and background monitoring.
- ⚡ **Real‑Time Actuation:** Built‑in sockets, watchers, and agents that don’t sleep.

Whether you're automating staking, swaps, liquidations, or interplanetary logic flows — Liquid OS is the backbone for your AI coordination layer.
