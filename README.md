![liquid Agent banner](/assets/1500x500.jpeg)

Liquid Agent is an autonomous AI coordination layer designed to power the next generation of decentralized systems.  
Modular. Intelligent. Always on.

This is not your average protocol logic. This is off‑world AI.

## 💧 What is Liquid Agent?  
Liquid Agent is an intelligent system that brings real‑time, AI‑powered automation to any decentralized environment. Originally incubated as an internal tool, it has now evolved into a standalone framework that enables:

-  **Autonomous Decision‑Making:** Reacts to on‑chain data, oracle updates, and time‑based triggers.
-  **Modular Prompts:** Swappable and extensible logic capsules for task‑specific decisions.
-  **Human‑AI Coordination:** Supports real‑time command execution and background monitoring.
-  **Real‑Time Actuation:** Built-in sockets, watchers, and agents that don’t sleep.

Whether you're automating staking, swaps, liquidations, or interplanetary logic flows — Liquid Agent is the backbone for your AI coordination layer.

## ⚡️ Key Features
**AI Agent Wallets:**
Secure, sandboxed wallets managed by autonomous agents—send, receive, and schedule crypto across all supported chains.

**Unified Dashboard:**
One place to track your portfolio, wallet history, and DeFi actions across Ethereum, PulseChain, Base, Avax, and more.

**Fiat Onramp Integration:**
Buy crypto instantly with cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, and more (no hassle onboarding).

**Automated DeFi:**
Stake, swap, and redeem in a few clicks—no manual signatures, no friction.

**Natural Language Chat:**
Ask anything, get insights, automate tasks, and interact with your AI assistant like you would with a human.

**Real-Time Sockets & Watchers:**
Live monitoring of on-chain activity, price feeds, and time-based events for instant AI-driven reactions.

## 📐 Architecture Overview
Liquid Agent is modular by design.
At its core you’ll find:

**Prompt Modules:**
Plug-and-play logic blocks for any workflow easy to extend for staking, onramps, trading, and more.

**AI Orchestration:**
Integrates with OpenAI (or local LLMs) for natural language, intent parsing, and autonomous actions.

**Wallet Engine:**
Agent wallets for every user, supporting EVM and cross-chain activity.

**Socket/Event Layer:**
Watchers and real-time execution for all supported protocols.

**Frontend UX:**
Modern dashboard for tracking, chatting, and interacting with your AI agent.
