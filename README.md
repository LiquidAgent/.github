This is not your average protocol logic. This is off-world AI.

## 🌌 What is Liquid Agent?
Liquid Agent is an intelligent system that brings real-time, AI-powered automation to any decentralized environment. Originally incubated as an internal tool, it has now evolved into a standalone framework that enables:

🧬 Autonomous Decision-Making: Reacts to on-chain data, oracle updates, and time-based triggers.

🪐 Modular Prompts: Swappable and extensible logic capsules for task-specific decisions.

🤖 Human-AI Coordination: Supports real-time command execution and background monitoring.

⚡ Real-Time Actuation: Built-in sockets, watchers, and agents that don’t sleep.

Whether you're automating staking, swaps, liquidations, or interplanetary logic flows — Liquid Agent is the backbone for your AI coordination layer.
