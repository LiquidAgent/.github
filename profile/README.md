## 🌌 What is Liquid Agent?  
Liquid Agent is an intelligent system that brings real‑time, AI‑powered automation to any decentralized environment. Originally incubated as an internal tool, it has now evolved into a standalone framework that enables:

- 🧬 **Autonomous Decision‑Making:** Reacts to on‑chain data, oracle updates, and time‑based triggers.
- 🪐 **Modular Prompts:** Swappable and extensible logic capsules for task‑specific decisions.
- 🤖 **Human‑AI Coordination:** Supports real‑time command execution and background monitoring.
- ⚡ **Real‑Time Actuation:** Built‑in sockets, watchers, and agents that don’t sleep.

Whether you're automating staking, swaps, liquidations, or interplanetary logic flows — Liquid Agent is the backbone for your AI coordination layer.
